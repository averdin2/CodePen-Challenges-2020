# CodePen-Challenges-2020

## Purpose

I am a bit late to the party for the 2020 CodePen challenges, but I figured I would still start from the January challenges and work on at least one challenge a week. My goal with this repository is to ensure that I maintain a constant flow of coding work every week.
